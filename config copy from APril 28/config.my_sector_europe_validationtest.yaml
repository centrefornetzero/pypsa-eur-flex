# docs
# TODO: PyPSA-Eur merge issue in prepare_sector_network.py
# regulate what components with which carriers are kept from PyPSA-Eur;
# some technologies are removed because they are implemented differently
# (e.g. battery or H2 storage) or have different year-dependent costs
# in PyPSA-Eur-Sec
pypsa_eur: #I think I need to add in conventional generators and buses into the file here, because right now the electric component carriers 
#are only the carriers that are given here, I think what is happening is that pypsa-eur when merging with the sector additions gets trimmed, and it's pruning too much

  Bus:
  - AC
  #- gas
  #- coal
  #- lignite
  #- import export tracker
  Link:
  - DC
  #- coal ## commenting these out to see if it will allow pypsa eur run on April 25 to bring back the emissions for these generators
  #- OCGT
  #- CCGT
  #- lignite
  #- biomass

  #led to biomass being used everywhere??? [Friday April 25], and a huge huge overestimation of generation
